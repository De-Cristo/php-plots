php-plots
=========

PHP based web index for image displaying

From an idea of Giovanni Petrucciani (@gpetrucc).

This project contains a PHP web index script to help visualizing folders with many images.

It is tailored to people working in High Energy Physics that use ROOT (http://root.cern.ch) to produce their plots.
